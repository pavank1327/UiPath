Hi Rakesh sir,

Again thanks for you videos'.
I always have queries on how actually robots works,, there licensing and allocation to different machines. Below is the question i got while studying from the UiPath Academy and i did not understand it very well could you please explain me.
 
Question : Which of the following sets of jobs can be run simultaneously using a pool of 3 machines connected using the same machine template having 3 runtimes?
Options :
- 5 jobs created using a foreground process
-
5 jobs created using a background process (Correct)
-3 jobs created using a foreground process and 5 jobs created using a background process (Correct)
-5 jobs created using a foreground process and 3 jobs created using a background process

Explanation :
An unattended robot can run maximum one foreground process and as many background processes. Hence, from the options presented, those that can be run are those that involve maximum 3 jobs created using a foreground process.
